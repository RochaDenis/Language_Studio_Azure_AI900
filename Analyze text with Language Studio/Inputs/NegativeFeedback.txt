I recently dined at Denis's Burger, and unfortunately, it was a rather disappointing experience. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance felt lackluster and uninviting. The service was incredibly slow, with servers seeming disinterested and inattentive to our needs.

Moving on to the food, I found it to be subpar at best. The burger I ordered was overcooked and dry, lacking any of the promised flavors. The accompanying fries were limp and soggy, indicating poor quality and careless preparation. Additionally, the prices did not align with the mediocre quality of the food.

Hygiene standards also left much to be desired. The tables were dirty, and the overall cleanliness of the restaurant was questionable.

Overall, my experience at Denis's Burger was highly unsatisfactory. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a quality dining experience. There are plenty of other burger joints in the area that undoubtedly offer better food and service.
